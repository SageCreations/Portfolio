These mini games were actually a side project that I made and tasked people on my team with making their own as well for inporting them in a browser game called GatherTown. GatherTown is a online meeting platform that looks like an old rpg in play style but works for an alternative to hosting conventions online. I was tasked were creating a script that uploaded assets and links to an art gallery room using info for the IEEE 2022 Convention.
